          <p>It’s common knowledge that the deadly mushroom is vividly colored and spotted, but what eludes most is that the deadliest of all mushrooms appears just like the everyday grocery mushrooms. Likewise, the threat to benevolence may come in part from the apparent, but not in any lesser part from the subtle, for beings lurking in the dark may practice malevolence without measure in a state of impunity. <br>
Nor is every reality distortion created by an apparent act of sophistry or blitheful ignorance; certain ones are attended with subtle eidolae. These eidolae are often disguised as one’s own thoughts, slithering into the inner reaches of the mind, and impressing it with subliminal effects on the basis of spurious notions, which, once taken root, become prejudicial to the host and may spread from one host to another by means of subsequent eidola emission.</p>

          <p>Reality does not meet the hype.</p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p> Many jumped on the AI hypewagon, but few understood the inner workings of AI, the underlying learning algorithms and decision trees that dictate its behaviors and outputs. And this general ignorance begets faith and fantasy in the actual capabilities of AI. As WSJ and industry insiders pointed out, even the best-known AIs out there frequently make errors of all sorts, from giving incorrect answers to basic math questions in natural language when phrased in a certain way; classifying filterable content incorrectly; to even getting basic facts wrong (e.g. the row number of CW in excel, the chapter of a book with a certain quote, the safe path in games where order or choices matter, travel requirements of a certain country, &c). While some errors may be the result of learning gaps, much of the error is attributed to the fact that it generally depends on webscraping for answers, and these answers they scraped or synthesized tend to be erroneous, in part or whole, because most information on the web are frivolous and specious (<a href="https://medium.com/@unfathomable/less-than-two-decades-ago-the-primary-means-of-instant-communication-were-phone-calls-sms-and-3d9b5f742862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the value of information</a>)
; for they are unable to reliably identify and separate out the dross before synthesizing them. <br>
To put simply, AI is a great helper and advisor, especially useful for quick reference or summary of certain information; but this utility ought not be construed in the absolute sense. Double checking with official/ authoritative sources or domain knowledge remains a necessary due diligence.
Also worth nothing is that AI doesn’t create, it recycles. Nearly every photo, video and textual content it “creates” is but a remix of those that already existed somewhere else. It’s analogous to Epicurus’ eidolae, in that everything humans can imagine or picture in their minds is but the reflection or remix of the things that already exist, as these things emit eidola (singular or composite). Humans cannot imagine something outside of the sandbox of defined existence. For example, the prevailing notion of an alien has eyes, head and limbs (features that already exist in humans or other living creatures), the pagan gods are but the remixes of existing animal body parts (eagle, dog, lion, elephant…), and so forth.

          <div class="section-heading">“PhD equates high IQ”</div>
          <div class="subheading">Verdict</div>
          <p>Human intelligence is much more nuanced than a vain title. </p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>PhD originated from the Netherlands around the 1800s for those who wanted to stay in school for longer than usual, by assisting their prof. Staying in school longer, or working as an assistant to some prof, by itself, doesn’t confer any real merit of any kind. You do not need to assist anyone for 4 or 40 years to prove an ounce of intelligence. 
Neither would those of the highest IQs stand in need of acting as an assistant to anyone at all, except in fictions. In the movie Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), Dr. Robotnik is said to have three PhDs. If such character existed in real life, he wouldn’t even pursue a single PhD in his field, for a genius of his caliber would not stand to benefit in an assistant capacity to anyone at all. If anything, his PhDs should’ve been entirely honorary, as in the case of the genius theologian John Gill who said, “I never sought it, thought it, nor bought it.” 
IQ is a function of genetics and environmental factors, not of the length of staying in school. <br>
Further, the quality of said school has more bearing than the nominal degree, as it implicates everything from the quality of alumni networks and academic resources down to teaching quality, all of which have more bearing on the outcomes of an alum than a nominal degree. For example, higher teaching quality generally leads to a solid and substantial foundation that supports innovation, as the ancient Chinese saying goes (名师出高徒) and history shows (Lao Tzu-Confucius; Plato-Aristotle; Epicurus-Lucretius; a higher frequency of eminent philosophers, statemen and generals among the alumni of ancient academies like Plato’s Academy, 岳麓书院  &c; and of business magnates, political leaders and Nobel laureates among the alumni of modern academies like The Ivy League/ Ancient Eight). Not every teacher is equal, as Plato noted in his debunking of the sophists, public teachers who knew little of substance but taught much. <br>
Finally, there’s no real threshold to getting any degrees these days. If one can read, one can get a PhD. The real difficulty comes from the selectiveness of schools of a certain quality or standard (e.g. Ivy degrees are very elusive vs. public school degrees), but not the degrees themselves. Matter-of-factly, one can get a PhD every four years from a number of second- and third-rate accredited universities at or near 100% acceptance rate in the U.S alone, if time permits. Even the average criminal has no issues getting a PhD from state or public university behind bars during their lengthy prison terms, if they chose to put their time to such use. <br>
Hence one cannot make an apple-to-apple comparison here. A Rolls-Royce is not comparable to a Toyota. If value is of concern, it's better to have a standard trim of RR than any trim of a Toyota. Any reasonable individual would've made the same choice without hesitation, assuming he was able to pick freely.

          <p>A misrepresentation of reality.</p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>The West’s greatest mind Plato did not make a distinction between the terms “knowledge” and “experience”, and often used them interchangeably in his dialogues. Whether one gleans a piece of information from direct observation or the observation of another (e.g. Art of War), both are considered experience (or knowledge for that matter). For example, the books of the ancient sages (e.g. Lao Tzu, Plato, Epicurus…) who have walked the full circle of human learning are not to be reckoned “dead” knowledge; a notion born of gross impertinence and ignorance, as this knowledge of theirs represent the vast experience accumulated through a life of deep observations, incisive insights and rigorous train of logic; passed down through the generations and stood the test of time; greatly exceeding the intellectual reaches of any ordinary man, past or present, when it comes to understanding the workings of man and society, and the nature of things.
To put into perspective, the ancient Greek philosophers were able to make out the existence and properties of the atom without the help of the microscope, only math and deductive logic; and the ancient Chinese calculated the orbital positions of planets and synodic periods to great exactness (< 0.3% difference from modern estimates, see《五星占》) without the help of the telescope or modern instruments that moderners took for granted. Thousands of years ago, Plato already noted the bane of democracy is the excess of freedom, how in the last days of democracy, criminals will walk free in the sun. And it corresponds to what we are seeing today, because the human nature has remained largely unchanged through time, making it predictable (and society being a magnification of that). 
Napoleon did not win his first major battle from direct sensory experience, which he did not have, but by applying the knowledge (experience of the greatest minds) from a pile of books. Alexander the Great, pupil of Aristotle (who was, in turn, a pupil of Plato), defeated the more experienced Persian King with but 1/10 of the army size, despite not having direct battlefield experience. In summary, it is the quality of the knowledge or experience that weighs most heavily, not their length or form. 1 year of depth beats 10 years of shallow. Written advice of the greatest minds beats the muscle memory of an ordinary man. When the ignorant man makes light of and dismisses knowledge of the greatest minds, oral or written, he is bound to bear the gratuitous consequences of many foolish mistakes at some point in life. In substantial cases (e.g. decisions in wars), it could be a matter of life and death, and there may not even be a second chance to iteratively learn it like an obstacle bumping cleaning robot.

          <p>A wild misrepresentation of human intelligence. </p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>Intelligence is a symphonious composition of three elements with equal importance: 1) Intellectual capacity, 2) Ingenuity, and 3) Insightfulness. The first refers to the ability to study and learn, aka. “Scholastic Aptitude” and has strong implications on a person’s memory, which is determined by both genetics and environmental factors such as brain health, access to education, socioeconomic conditions, personal efforts, instincts and tendencies, among a host of other factors, mainly elements of Necessity. The second refers to the ability to perform creative, tactical and strategic maneuvers in all facets of life (e.g. business, personal), which can be acquired immediately through sensory experiences; or mediately through scholastic pursuits and observations (e.g. consulting the wisdom of ancient sages). The last refers to the ability to see things others can’t, which can be acquired immediately through sensory experiences or mediately through scholastic pursuits and observations.
A quick critique of common measures of intelligence (2022):
1.	Intelligence Quotient Test: too vague and biased to be useful, with no clear standards from one test to another.
2.	“Emotional Quotient”: too vague and biased to be useful; it tries to metastasize away from the complete definition of intelligence in order to rationalize one’s inability or indolent tendencies to study and learn, making it a resort of comfort to those who didn’t have the scholastic aptitude.
3.	Brain-to-Body Mass Ratio: achieves a certain accuracy but relies too much on generalization.
4.	Encephalization Quotient: comparable from one population group to the next, but the results are overly speculative.

          <p>Case dependent</p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>Generally, as you grow older, you tend to become more mellow, benevolent and entertains a more accurate understanding of the world in its breadth and depth. But this is not always the case, and has become an increasingly rare case, especially for those who have been pampered at the hands of Necessity from their youth upwards. They may be already in their 50s or even 70s, but their experience is shallow, their world views narrow, and their minds flushed with hubris and ignorance; their experience having no depth nor complexity; they are like the dross, scrap irons that have not been refined for decades. They may think they’ve seen the light of the world, when in reality all they’ve been gazing at was the fire in Plato’s cave where all their lives were spent. They have not seen the heights of heaven, having not associated with those in the high places; nor have they known the depths of the earth, having not undergone enough pains and suffering or understood philosophy; enough to understand benevolence, foster character development, and to attain an accurate world view. They have lived as a spoiled child then, and as a manchild now, with no possibility of redemption until they are inundated with afflictive providence.
The foolish manchild in a nutshell (having at least three or more of these tendencies).: 
•	lacks benevolence, having no hearty affection or true care and concern for his neighbors, unless done in public for popular applause (because they still care about personal reputation); 
•	not soft-spoken, graceful, and patient;
•	fraught with bad habits, reveling in smoking, drinking, and/or carnal pleasures, at least in private; 
•	 “Strain at a gnat but swallow a camel”: Fuss about trifles while ignoring more serious matters, as he cannot differentiate between the weights of matters in life (e.g. a drunk husband who criticize wife and children for every little act that did not please his eye, and yet overlook his own harmful repertoire of domestic violence, smoking and other carnal indulgences)
•	often interrupts others when they are speaking;
•	Can’t take real criticism, and instead use sophistry to rationalize his every mistake. In 《道德经》第八十二章’s original text, the great sage Lao Tzu considers those who are well-versed or sharp-witted in sophistries to be morally depraved: “善者不辨，辩者不善” (here “辩” 指 “巧辩” 或 “诡辩”)
•	sees and attends to only the surface of matters or misrepresentations of reality, for he has no philosophy and understood not the essence of things. 
•	Generally, not of a noble extract and upbringing, and did not receive a well-rounded education of any substance from his youth upwards; which tends to hubris and ignorance through adult and later life
Any old man who maintains this character is not a fine wine well aged, but one rotten and spoiled. But of course, this is not to say that everything that a foolish manchild does must necessarily be wrong, for, if anything, even the vilest person can do certain things right.

          <p>A misrepresentation of reality.</p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>We often hear of the self-made millionaire or billionaire who wrought their success with their own hands. But the reality is that there’s no such thing as self-made. All things achieved by any man are the consequence of 99% mechanical and/or providential Necessity and 1% collateral effort, which is tokenism in comparison to the works Necessity have wrought for them. And this respects not whether one inherited a bag of gold from the start, or acquired it through an eventful progression. One can only put meaningful effort into a specific direction, where he has already been given the prerequisite Necessity to do so. Even when Plato exhorted men to the pursuit of philosophy, he only meant those who are fitted by nature and circumstance to treat this most important subject, as not everyone is so fitted by Necessity (e.g. direct or indirect access to the right teacher, status of enslavement, compatible temperament, among other upstream conditions).
To further illustrate the case, we’ll use the case of the great sage Marquis Zhugeliang, which I will treat in Chinese, language of the original text, for utmost clarity.
亮曰：‘’...若事之不济，此乃天也...‘’ （三国志-诸葛亮传）
诸葛亮智谋超群，目光如炬。但他竭尽了全力屡次北伐也未能制魏或收复中原；虽为蜀奠定了根基，创造了各种有利条件，然未改大势。
随着时间的演变，人可以创造或转化出有利于己的条件，可是这仅是在已具备某些上游条件的基础上创造或转化出来的下游条件。
（viz. mechanical & providential Necessity: spacetime event ordering/eidolae/status effects/assets such as state population, # of gifted individuals, state economics.../friendly assets/assets of the mind, &c)。
1）比如天时 (in the case of spacetime event ordering）：司马懿如果在五丈原中了某个计，或做了某个判断错误（owing to eidolae/status effects/passion and desires/flaws of the assets/flaws of the mind, &c）；给诸葛亮留了可出牌的空间，诸葛亮才有可能把握主动权，逐渐控制局势，甚至扭转乾坤。
2）或基础上游条件（in the case of # gifted individuals）：“曹操比于袁绍、 则名微而众寡、 然操遂能克绍、 以弱为强者、 非惟天时、 抑亦人谋也”（三国志-诸葛亮传）
（译文：‘’...就拿曹操跟袁绍来说、 最开始曹操既没有名气、 又缺乏实力。但是、 后来袁绍被他打败了。曹操之所以能够以弱胜强、 不仅是因为占据了天时、更是因片手下有一大堆优秀的谋臣武将为他服务。现在曹操军队已达百万...‘’）

简之而言，诸葛亮受限于上游条件，而条件不能凭空创。人仅创出下游条件，在上游条件的基础上（允许的情况下）。
Necessity在万事上占有优先次序，不可逆，若水之归海；凡人无法通过自行修改elements of Necessity来实现个人目的。
根据央视/金鹰纪事，诸葛亮深知他毫无胜算由于这一蜀臭牌（viz. unfavorable Necessity) 与魏实力对比悬殊太大，用以打赢只能靠一系列微妙的上游条件或“天意”（诸葛亮未能享）；蜀道基础条件薄弱使计谋受限，有牌也不能出，难于上青天；但他北伐的核心动机是为了报答刘备知遇之恩，不负白帝城之托。
And here we cannot say that 诸葛亮’s loyal, upright and noble spirit is a flaw of the mind, as this is a matter of personality or values, which necessarily differ from one creature to the next. Personality is a bundle of unique decision-making rules and associated weightings, and though these rules are adaptive, any adjustments to such rules are restricted to those rules that have been foreordained by Necessity. In light of this and the particular context given, there is nothing wrong about 诸葛亮’s valuing virtues above personal gains; nor is there anything right about the 司马懿’s cunning and conspiring nature, valuing personal gains above all else; except an acknowledgement that this latter personality type tends to amassing power and fortune for himself when all other factors are constant (and he did just that, having planted the seeds for his sons to usurp the throne of his liege in the making of the 晋dynasty).

          <div class="section-heading">“Smoking and drinking are the signs of manhood or adulthood”</div>
          <div class="subheading">Verdict</div>
          <p>Quite the opposite</p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>Indulgence in smoking, drinking, drugs or any other harmful relievers generally betrays a weakness in character and a feeble mind, an intent to escape reality by numbing oneself with one of the above agents, for he is unable to bear the pressures of life through sheer willpower. 
To say that it is customary to smoke when doing business is just as false. In 2014, the chairman of the Chinese tobacco conglomerate was on the news after being discovered to be someone who doesn’t even smoke himself. Warren Buffet and numerous other moguls don’t smoke either and are even teetotal. It shows that a real man does not need to use these harmful relievers to manage pressure, because he has a mind and will strong enough to bear such pressures.
Having said that, drinking is not entirely without its utility. In times of great distress, for example bereavement of someone important to you, or to manage the horrors of wartime experience, drinking in moderation can be helpful when dealing with excessive grief. As the Bible instructs, “Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts” (Proverbs 31:6 KJV).

          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>As Epicurus noted, not every pleasure should be taken, nor every pain be refused. Certain medicine or surgery may be distasteful or painful to the senses but it is for the long-term benefits and relief that they ought to be taken. Contrarily, reveling in drugs, drinking and sex may gratify the senses for the time being, but this is usually attended with consequences that inflict more pain over the long term. <br>
In 《道德经》第八十二章’s original text, the great sage Lao Tzu considers the truth tends not to be pleasant to the ears, and that which is pleasant to the ears tends not to be the truth: "信言不美，美言不信"(where “信言” 指真实的话语，“美言” 指华丽的言辞) <br>
Appearances do not conflict with reality nor the underlying order of things. An evil man in white robes does not render the man good; nor does the evil in that man renders the white garments bad. So, while there is nothing necessarily wrong about admiring the appearances, these appearances have no bearing on the underlying realities. Appreciating Hitler’s art pieces for its pure artistic value does not render the audience more or less benevolent in character.

          <p>The argument of an unscrupulous and unprincipled man who has no philosophy in them. Relative they may be, but not equal. As Plato noted, things can be closer or further from a point of absolute truth such as just or unjust, even if that absolute point cannot be fully attained. And these positions are not interchangeable as the unprincipled man may argue in an attempt to justify his vile actions. He who cannot distinguish between petty and grave crimes is not mere unprincipled, he is a true danger to society. The known human societies allocate punishments in accordance to the severity of the crime, or the degree of harm caused to the society or victim, e.g. third-degree burn, second-degree murder. Pickpockets who steal out of survival instincts are not to be reckoned with the lot of Ted Bundy. Having said that, there aren’t usually beings of absolute evil that can be found; not that there aren’t one in a thousand permutations. Plato explained that, to be in the superlative state of evil, you have to be in a state of complete chaos and unable to cooperate with anyone at all. Even Ted Bundy has some commendable qualities, such as his respect for his mother. Or Hitler, for that matter. Hitler doesn’t smoke or drink, and is generally sober and soft-spoken (according to the train tape, one of the few surviving records of his true voice and bearing). 
Epicurus calls the unprincipled man a fool. Plato mocks those who think in democracies neither political party have any differences whatsoever (i.e. they are equal). No, there are as many differences as there are an infinite permutation of leader qualities, however subtle; and it is the citizen’s obligation to determine which of these differences, on the whole, are better or worse for the nation over the long term by the best means of information available to him. Everything in life is rarely equal, but rather comes by measures and degrees (what the ancient Chinese called “三六九等”). The cruise experience, for instance, doesn’t come in equal, and cannot be defined by a simple fact of “I went on a cruise and this is how cruises are,” because every seasoned cruiser knows that the actual cruise experience is largely determined by the age of the ship, cabin class and customizations, and the cruise brand (e.g. Norwegian, Royal, Carnival, or expedition brands). For example, the quality of meals generally scales with the ship’s build age (newer the better), and varies significantly from brand to another (e.g. NCL vs. Carnival). No further from the truth it is to say that all cruise experience is terrible simply because you booked the cheapest cabin on the oldest ship of the Carnival fleet (not that there is anything wrong with the choice, but that it is far from the best representative of the cruise experience).
There are also fools who justify their actions from the acts of nature. Preposterous are those who draw their morals from the acts of nature when attempting to defend their questionable conducts. The order of nature is not benevolent at the core. There are countless examples but one will suffice: a tropical fish like the guppy will feed on its own fries as soon as they left its gravid spot. Is this something we ought to imitate? Anyone who responds with a resounding “yes” should be helicoptered to the jungle where it belongs.

          <p>An ignorant misrepresentation of reality</p>
          <div class="subheading">Notes</div>
          <p>Just as good and evil people, alike, bare and raise children; so, do good and evil people, alike, own pets, since ancient times. 
Most of the population of our times have or had a domesticated living creature (or “pets”) of some kind over the course of their lives, be it avian (canaries, parrots, finches…), amphibian (turtles, lizards, snakes…), aquatic (salt and freshwater fish), insects (snails, ants, crickets…), mammal (porcupine, hamster, dog, cat, tiger), flora (money tree, cactus, peace lily, other houseplants…), be it what it will; as part of an ancestral human habit. Even Adolf Hitler was a dog owner, and, in fact, owned multiple dogs, particularly the German Shepherd.
And in most, if not all, cases no one purchases a pet for the sole good of the pet, but rather for the personal comfort, psychological needs (companionship, curiosity…) or general utility, of the pet owner. Not that there is anything necessarily wrong about having a pet to alleviate depression, for example; but that ownership of any pet, by itself, has little bearing on the general character traits or tendencies of the owner.

          <div class="subheading">Interesting Fact</div>
          <p>In contemporary periods, why do we see a higher human affinity with dogs and cats? Because it traces back to their ancestral utility in hunting and deratization, for which reason they were originally domesticated. Dogs, in particular, were domesticated even by barbarians and savages of antiquity, as Darwin repeatedly noted (see <em>The Origins of Species</em>, Unabridged). Wolves may be a better predator than dogs, but they are instinctual and cannot be domesticated effectively. The ancestral period of widespread utilitarian domestication of dogs and cats has contributed to the contemporary trends in pet selection we see today. </p>
